# DATA_ANALYST_A_B_TEST_webpage
Understanding the results of an A/B test ran by an e-commerce website
### by Jérôme d'Harveng

## Introduction

>A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  This notebook linked to the UDACITY DATA ANALYST NANODEGREE walks through
some possible difficulties. 
>For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an **e-commerce website**. 
> The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
